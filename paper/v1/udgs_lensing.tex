\begin{abstract}
        The recent discovery of thousands of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in nearby galaxy clusters has opened a new window into the process of galaxy formation and evolution. Among the key features that could reveal their formation history and ability to survive in the harsh cluster environments are the masses of these UDGs. We use weak gravitational lensing measurements around 909 UDGs in 21 clusters at $z\leq0.09$ to constrain the average UDG mass. Our measurements constrain the average mass of subhaloes hosting UDGs to $\log m_{\rm UDG}/\Msun\leq11.45$, within a radius $r\sim40$ kpc, at 95\percent\ confidence. Although uncertainties are large, our lensing measurements suggest that UDGs are dwarfs and not failed $L^*$ galaxies.

\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}

Large, low surface brightness galaxies have been known to exist both in the field \citep{} and in galaxy clusters \citep{} for some time. \textbf{their properties etc.}

A subset of these low surface brightness galaxies---dubbed ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) by \cite{vandokkum15}---has recently started receiving particular attention. These UDGs are large ($\reff\geq1.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$, where $\reff$ is the half-light radius), low-surface brightness galaxies (with central surface brightnesses $\mu_0\sim26-28\,\mathrm{mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$) initially discovered in the Coma Cluster \citep{vandokkum15,koda15,yagi16}, and later in Virgo \citep{mihos15} and Fornax \citep{munoz15}, and even in a number of more distant ($0.04\leq z \leq0.07$) clusters \citep{vdburg16}. %Their stellar masses ($\Mstar\sim10^8\,\Msun$) and structural properties (axes ratio, surface brightness and S\'ersic index) are similar to those of normal dwarfs, but UDGs have sizes comparable to the Milky Way (with a total mass $M\sim10^{12}\,\Msun$).
UDGs have dwarf-like stellar masses, $\Mstar\sim10^8\,\Msun$ \citep[e.g.,][]{vdburg16}, but sizes comparable to the Milky Way, which has a total mass $M\sim10^{12}\,\Msun$.

%\textbf{note however \cite{roman16}, who found UDGs all the way to filaments around A168.}
% While each cluster can host hundreds of UDGs, there are very few UDGs in the field \citep{vdburg16}, suggesting that their formation and evolution are intimately linked to the cluster environment.
Several hypotheses have been put forth to try to explain the unexpected survival of UDGs in massive clusters. In the initial discovery of UDGs in the Coma Cluster, \cite{vandokkum15} suggested that UDGs may be failed $L^*$ galaxies which fell into the cluster at early times, after having used only a small fraction of their cold gas to form stars. Once part of the clusters, their remaining cold gas was removed and these were left as very dark matter dominated galaxies; %This scenario is supported by tidal disruption arguments, and is also consistent with the statistical analysis of \cite{vdburg16}, and \cite{yozin15} showed using numerical simulations that this is indeed a feasible scenario.
\cite{yozin15} have shown that such a mechanism can indeed reproduce the properties of UDGs in numerical simulations.
Alternatively, \cite{amorisco16} suggested that UDGs are high-spin versions of normal dwarf galaxies; their high spin would allow them to withstand the strong tidal torques exerted by the cluster. This hypothesis makes two specific predictions: that UDGs are rotation-dominated galaxies, and that they should also be abundant in the field. Both predictions are in apparent contradiction with the UDGs observed in Coma and other clusters, but observations are not yet conclusive enough.
\textbf{also \cite{dicintio16}, who argue that UDGs may form due to internal feedback processes in normal dwarfs, and should also be abundant in the field}

If there is one quantity which plays a crucial role in the distinction between these different sets of hypothesis, it is arguably the total masses of UDGs. Knowing the masses of UDGs would allow us to unambiguously rule out some classes of hypotheses as those summarized above. There have already been attempts at estimating the masses of individual UDGs. \cite{beasley16_virgo} measured a velocity dispersion of globular clusters associated with a UDG in the Virgo Cluster of $33_{-10}^{+16}\,\kms$ within 8.1 kpc, which suggests a virial mass\footnote{Note that subhaloes cannot be physically assigned a virial mass, since they are embedded in the potential of the host cluster. However, referring to virial masses offers a convenient point for comparison. We therefore adhere to the use of virial masses in this discussion, but adopt a different mass definition in our analysis (see \Cref{s:results}). See also the discussion in \citet{sifon16_satellites}.} $m_{200}\sim10^{11}\,\Msun$. Similar values for the total masses of UDGs have been obtained from the number of globular clusters \citep{beasley16_acs,peng16}. All these measurements therefore suggest that UDGs are in fact dwarf galaxies and not failed $L^*$ galaxies. On the other hand, \cite{vandokkum16} estimated a virial mass $m\sim10^{12}\Msun$ from the stellar velocity dispersion and globular cluster count of a large ($\reff=4.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$) UDG, comparable to the mass of the Milky Way---possibly a failed $L^*$ galaxy. Since all of the above mass estimations refer to single UDGs, it is not clear how they can be interpreted in the context of the UDG population. For this reason, measurements of the masses of a representative population of UDGs are required to draw conclusions about their origin.

Only weak gravitational lensing can provide direct measurements of the \emph{average} total masses of galaxies. The challenge with weak lensing is that we need to measure the tiny distortions on (faint) background galaxies produced by the lens galaxies. In the case of UDGs, or cluster galaxies in general, this is complicated by the fact that these distortions are hidden by the much larger distortion induced by the cluster itself. However, the two contributions can be cleanly separated if background galaxies can be identified in enough numbers and at small angular separations \citep[$R\ll\langle\Rsat\rangle$, where $\langle\Rsat\rangle$ is the typical cluster-centric distance of the galaxies in question; see][]{yang06,sifon15_kids}. This requires deep imaging surveys with small point spread functions observing thousands of cluster galaxies. Given the technical challenges, these \emph{satellite galaxy-galaxy lensing} measurements have only been possible in the last few years \citep{li14,li16,sifon15_kids,sifon16_satellites}. These studies have provided direct constraints on the mass content of the general cluster galaxy population, and serve as a valuable reference point for mass measurements of UDGs.

In this work, we present weak gravitational lensing measurements of the masses of UDGs in a sample of 21 clusters at $z<0.1$ taken from the Multi-Epoch Nearby Cluster Survey (\meneacs). We present the data and summarize the weak lensing formalism in \Cref{s:data}. We discuss the modelling of the signal and the resulting constraints on UDG masses in \Cref{s:results}, and discuss the implications of our measurements in \Cref{s:discussion}. Throughout this work we adopt a flat \lcdm\ model with $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.315$ and $H_0=70\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, consistent with the latest results of the \planck\ satellite \citep{planck15xiii}.

\meneacs\ is a multi-epoch survey of 57 clusters at $z\leq0.15$ carried out with Megacam in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope \citep{sand12}. The data reduction is described in detail by \cite{vdburg13}. Here, it suffices to say that the reduction followed standard steps using the \textsc{elixir} pipeline \citep{magnier04}. The resulting full width at half maximum of the point spread function is less than 1 arcsec for all clusters in the sample, and the photometric zero points have been calibrated to about 0.01 mag.
%
We consider 21 of those 57 clusters, located at $z\leq0.09$. These clusters have masses $M_{200}\geq10^{14}\,\Msun$, where $M_{200}$ is the dynamical mass estimated by \cite{sifon15_cccp}. %\cite{vdburg16} showed, using eight clusters, that the number of UDGs in a cluster scales almost linearly with cluster mass.
Our cluster sample is listed in \Cref{t:clusters}.

Following the original definition by \cite{vandokkum15}, \cite{vdburg16} identified UDGs as galaxies with surface brightnesses within one effective radius of $24.0\leq \langle\mu(r,\reff)\rangle\leq26.5$ and effective radii $1.5\leq\reff/\mathrm{kpc}\leq7.0$; these parameters were measured with \galfit\ \citep{peng02,peng10}. In order to have a sample that is as pure as possible but still obtain a large enough number of UDG candidates, \cite{vdburg16} considered eight clusters at $0.04\leq z \leq0.07$ and at galactic latitude $b\geq25^\circ$. The study of \cite{vdburg16} is unique in that they did not select UDGs by visual inspection after the automatic selection based on structural parameters. While this has the disadvantage that the sample may be (and in fact is, as we show below) contaminated by artefacts of various kinds, it allows for an objective, statistically-consistent study of their properties after accounting for the expected number of such objects in control fields. This contamination however can significantly alter lensing measurements in a way that may not be fully captured by subtracting the signal from a control sample.

We start from the sample compiled by \cite{vdburg16}, but take some additional steps to define the sample used for weak lensing measurements. We first expand the cluster sample to $z\leq0.09$ in order to increase the number of UDGs in our sample. We also impose stricter size cuts on the UDG sample $\reff\geq2.0\,\mathrm{kpc}$ for $z\leq0.065$ and $\reff\geq3.0\,\mathrm{kpc}$ for higher redshifts, as we find that these cuts significantly reduce the contamination of the sample. Finally, we visually inspected all UDG candidates and only kept high-confidence UDG candidates. We classify a UDG candidate as high-confidence if it is unambiguously an isolated galaxy whose \galfit\ parameters are expected to be accurate (i.e., without significant residuals in a model-subtracted image), but do not make any visual selection based on surface brightness or morphology. While this slightly subjective selection could potentially bias statistical analyses such as that carried by \cite{vdburg16}, it is essential for a clean interpretation of lensing measurements around the UDGs. We show the distribution of stellar mass of our final sample of UDGs in \Cref{f:hist}.

\subsection{Weak lensing measurements}

Our weak lensing analysis is identical in methodology to that presented in \cite{sifon16_satellites}, which follows closely the analysis of \cite{hoekstra15}. The weak lensing signal is measured as an average tangential alignment, or shear, $\gammat$, of galaxies in the background of the lenses (in this case, UDGs) using the moments-based KSB algorithm \citep{kaiser95,luppino97,hoekstra98}. The shear is closely related to the excess surface density, $\esd$, 
\begin{equation}
 \esd \equiv \bar\Sigma(<R) - \bar\Sigma(R) = \sigmac\gammat,
\end{equation}
where $\bar\Sigma(<R)$ and $\bar\Sigma(R)$ are the average surface densities within a projected radius\footnote{As a convention, we list two-dimensional distances with upper case $R$ and three-dimensional distances with lower case $r$.} $R$ and within a thin shell around $R$, respectively, and $\sigmac$ is a geometric factor accounting for the lensing efficiency,
\begin{equation}
 \sigmac \equiv \frac{c^2}{4\pi G} \frac{D_\mathrm{s}}{D_\mathrm{l}D_\mathrm{ls}},
\end{equation}
with $D_\mathrm{s}$, $D_\mathrm{l}$ and $D_\mathrm{ls}$ being the angular diameter distances to the source, to the lens, and between the lens and the source.

We define our source sample as all galaxies with $r$-band magnitude $20\leq m_\mathrm{phot} \leq 24.5$ and sizes $r_\mathrm{h}<5\,\mathrm{pix}$. In addition, \citet{sifon16_satellites} identified a population of sources with biased estimates of the background level. Removing these galaxies serves effectively as a deblending step, and removes an additonal 10--15\percent\ of source galaxies, which we also apply here. As in \cite{sifon16_satellites}, we do not apply any colour cuts, but correct the lensing measurements with a `boost factor' that accounts for contamination by cluster members. This boost factor has been caibrated using tailor-made image simulations. In addition, \cite{sifon16_satellites} used the same image simulations to describe and account for an additive bias in the tangential shear due to the light from the lens galaxies. The lens sample of \cite{sifon16_satellites} is composed of typical, bright ($m_\mathrm{phot}=14-20$) cluster galaxies, and this additive correction is significant but confined to very small scales ($R<50\,\mathrm{kpc}$). However, it is entirely negligible for UDGs, given their low surface brightness.


\section{The weak lensing signal of Ultra Diffuse Galaxies}
\label{s:results}

\subsection{Model for the UDG lensing signal}

As described in detail in \cite{yang06} and \cite{sifon15_kids}, the satellite lensing signal can be described by the sum of a subhalo and a host halo terms, both of which are essentially independent of each other. We model the average density profile of both UDGs and the host clusters as NFW profiles \citep{nfw95}.
% ,
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:nfw}
%  \rho(x) = \frac{\delta_\mathrm{c}\rho_\mathrm{m}}{x\,(1+x)^2},
% \end{equation}
% where $x \equiv r/\rs$, with $\rs$ the scale radius, and $\rho_\mathrm{m}=3H_0^2(1+z)^3\Omega_\mathrm{m}/(8\pi G)$ is the mean density of the Universe at redshift $z$. In addition, $\delta_\mathrm{c}$ is a function of the concentration, $c$,
% \begin{equation}
%  \delta_\mathrm{c}=\frac{200}{3}\frac{c^3}{\ln(1+c)-c/(1+c)}.
% \end{equation}
%
Following \cite{sifon16_satellites}, we define the mass of subhaloes hosting UDGs, $m_\mathrm{bound}$, as the bound mass---that is, the mass within the region where the density is above the background density of the cluster. In order to estimate the background density, we take the expected value for the three-dimensional radius based on the number density profile of normal cluster galaxies measured by \cite{vdburg15}, which provides a good description of the distribution of UDGs outside $R_\mathrm{sat}\sim0.15\radius$. Specifically,
\begin{equation}
 \langle r_\mathrm{UDG} \rangle = 
%   \frac{\int_{0.15}^c \mathrm{d}x' x'\,\rho(x', c)}{\int_{0.15}^c \mathrm{d}x' \rho(x', c)},
  \left[\int_{0.15c}^c d\chi\,\rho(\chi, c)\right]^{-1}
    \int_{0.15c}^c d\chi\,\chi\,\rho(\chi, c) = 0.38r_\mathrm{200,h}\,,
\end{equation}
where $\rho(x, c)$ is the NFW profile and $c=2$ \citep{vdburg15,vdburg16}.
Our model therefore has four free parameters: the average masses and concentrations of UDGs and the corresponding ones for host clusters. In practice, the parameters for the host clusters are poorly constrained, and we treat them as nuisance parameters.


\subsection{Constraints on the average UDG mass}

\begin{figure}
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{esd.pdf}}
\caption{Lensing signal of ultra-diffuse galaxies in clusters at $z\leq0.09$. Orange and yellow regions show the 68 and 95\percent\ credible intervals from the MCMC sampling, while the black line shows the best-fit model.}
\label{f:esd}
\end{figure}

% \begin{figure}
%  \centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{corner.pdf}}
% \end{figure}

We show in \Cref{f:esd} the lensing signal of our sample of UDGs, along with the best-fit model. We are not able to constrain the concentrations of either UDGs or the host clusters, and we marginalize over the concentration parameters. For UDGs we use a range $10 \leq c_\udg \leq 20$, which covers the expected average concentrations of subhaloes in the mass range $\log m/\Msun \sim 10-12$ and at cluster-centric distances $0.1\lesssim r/r_\mathrm{200,cl} \lesssim 1$ \citep{moline16}. Similarly, we set $2 \leq c_\mathrm{cl} \leq 8$ for the host clusters \citep[e.g.,][]{dutton14}.

Our model constrains the `virial' mass of subhaloes to $\log m_{200}/\Msun\leq11.94$ at 95\percent\ credibility. At an average cluster-centric distance of $\langle r_\udg \rangle=0.38r_\mathrm{200,cl}$, this results in a bound mass $\log m_\bound/\Msun\leq 11.45$ within a radius $r_\bound=41_{-37}^{+41}\,\mathrm{kpc}$ at 95\percent\ credibility. The wide range in $r_\bound$ is given by the range in allowed host cluster masses, which changes both the background density and the value of $r_\mathrm{200,cl}$. The best-fit host cluster mass is $\log\Mcl/\Msun=14.96_{-0.11}^{+0.11}$ (68\percent\ credible interval).

These results are somewhat dependent on the range chosen for $c_\udg$, with lower concentrations allowing for higher subhalo masses. However, it is unlikely that subhaloes would have concentrations much lower than $c=10$---these are in fact the typical concentrations of \emph{host} haloes of these masses \citep[e.g.,][]{dutton14,moline16}.

To allow a comparison with recent measurements of UDG masses from stellar dynamics and globular clusters, we also report the upper limit for the mass within 10 kpc, $m_\mathrm{<10\,kpc}\leq XX\,\Msun$, but we note that this value is an extrapolation of the data---a result of the adopted NFW profile.


\section{Discussion}
\label{s:discussion}
 
Weak gravitational lensing measures the total mass irrespective of its nature. The median stellar mass of UDGs in our sample is $\langle m_\star \rangle = 2.0\times10^8\,\Msun$. Thus their dark matter fraction can be as high as 99.9\percent, although we are not able to detect mass in excess of the stellar mass. Lensing has the advantage compared to stellar dynamics that it probes the total masses of galaxies, instead of the masses within the small radii within which velocity dispersions can be measured \citep[e.g., roughly 8 kpc in the case of DF17 in the Coma cluster][]{beasley16_acs,peng16}, and therefore allows a more straightforward comparison with other kinds of galaxies, without the need for an extrapolation of the density profile from $\sim8$ kpc to tens of kpc (although lensing also relies to some extent on an assumed density profile).

However, weak lensing has therefore the disadvantage that the total and stellar masses are measured at very different radii, and the question of how dark matter--dominated these galaxies are, compared to dwarf or `normal' galaxies, is difficult to address.

Our weak lensing measurements suggest the typical UDG (with $\langle\reff\rangle\sim3$ kpc) resides in a dark matter halo that contains at most half the mass of the Milky Way. This supports the idea that UDGs are dwarfs, as opposed to failed $L^*$ galaxies. This is in agreement with the mass suggested by globular cluster counts in a $\reff=2.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$ UDG in the Coma cluster \citep{beasley16_acs,peng16}. On the other hand, \cite{vandokkum16} estimated a virial mass of about $10^{12}\,\Msun$ for DF44 (also in Coma). This UDG has a stellar mass $m_\star\sim3\times10^8\,\Msun$, similar to the average stellar mass in our sample, but an effective radius $\reff\sim4.5\,\mathrm{kpc}$, not representative of UDGs in general. The total mass inferred by \cite{vandokkum16} suggests either that DF44 is an outlier, \emph{compared to the population of UDGs}, in terms of its total-to-stellar mass ratio, or that the assumed extrapolation from a dynamical mass of $7\times10^9\,\Msun$ within 4.6 kpc to a virial mass of $\sim10^{12}\,\Msun$ is not valid. For this extrapolation, \cite{vandokkum16} assumed a concentration of $c\sim10$ \citep{maccio08}, at the low end of our chosen range. As discussed above, lowering the concentration tends to increase the mass allowed by our lensing measurements, and this may partly explain the fact that we consider DF44 an outlier. A study of the velocity dispersion of a statistical sample of UDGs may help understand this difference.

Our upper limit on the mass of UDGs suggests that they are not strong outliers in the total-to-stellar mass relation of cluster galaxies, as measured by \cite{sifon16_satellites}. So far, theoretical scenarios in which UDGs are dwarf galaxies also require an abundant field UDG population. A study of field UDGs would face the additional challenge that it would be very difficult to determine their redshifts in large numbers.
