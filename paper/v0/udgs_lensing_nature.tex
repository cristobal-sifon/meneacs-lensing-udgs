\begin{abstract}
    The recent discovery of large populations of ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in nearby galaxy clusters\cite{koda15,vandokkum15,vdburg16} has opened a new window into the process of galaxy formation and evolution. These galaxies have as much stellar matter as dwarf galaxies but appear as large in size as the Milky Way
\end{abstract}

Then the body of the main text appears after the intro paragraph.
Figure environments can be left in place in the document.
\verb|\includegraphics| commands are ignored since Nature wants
the figures sent as separate files and the captions are
automatically moved to the end of the document (they are printed
out with the \verb|\end{document}| command. However, tables must
be manually moved to the end of the document, after the addendum.

\begin{figure}
 \centerline{\includegraphics[width=3in]{test.pdf}}
\caption{Each figure legend should begin with a brief title for
the whole figure and continue with a short description of each
panel and the symbols used. For contributions with methods
sections, legends should not contain any details of methods, or
exceed 100 words (fewer than 500 words in total for the whole
paper). In contributions without methods sections, legends should
be fewer than 300 words (800 words or fewer in total for the whole
paper).}
