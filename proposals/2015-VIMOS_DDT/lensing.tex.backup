\section*{Galaxy-galaxy lensing by galaxies in clusters}

The galaxy-galaxy lensing signal is measured by azimuthally averaging the shapes of background sources around foreground, lens galaxies. This azimuthal averaging ensures that, at scales small enough where the cluster potential is approximately constant, the contribution to the lensing signal from the cluster itself is exactly zero. At larger distances from the galaxy, approaching the distance to the cluster centre, the cluster contribution rapidly takes over and dominates the signal. However, we do not expect any contribution from the galaxy itself at these scales, so effectively the two contributions are independent; this is shown in Fig.\ 1 (see also Fig.\ 6 of Sif\'on et al.\ 2015 for a demonstration that both contributions are uncorrelated).

Therefore, to measure the lensing signal arising from galaxies in clusters one must have a high source density because the signal from the galaxy is noticeable only at very small scales ($\lesssim100$ kpc, depending on the distance from the galaxy to the cluster centre). We are able to do this thanks to our deep, low-seeing ($\lesssim0.8''$) CFHT images. Fig.\ 3 shows the stellar-to-total mass relation for all galaxies in the MENeaCS cluster sample, from which our UDG sample is drawn. This has been obtained from measurements around 8,000 galaxies (Sif\'on et al., in prep.)

\caption{\small Left: predicted lensing signal of clusters with masses $\log M_{\rm host}/M_\odot=13.2,13.4,13.6$. Changing the cluster mass only changes the amplitude of the signal but not the scale at which it is different from zero. Right: predicted signal of galaxies of mass $\log M_{\rm sat}/M_\odot=11.0,11.2,11.4$ in a cluster with $\log M_{\rm host}/M_\odot=13.4$ at a distance $R_{\rm sat}\sim100\,{\rm kpc}$ from the cluster centre. The glitch is produced by the sharp truncation assumed for the galaxy. Taken from Sif\'on et al.\ (2015, MNRAS, 454, 3938).}

\caption{\small Lensing signal of galaxies in low-mass galaxy clusters identified in the GAMA survey, using background sources from the Kilo-Degree Survey. Contours show 68 and 95\% credible intervals of best-fit NFW profiles obtained through an MCMC. The best-fit masses of galaxies in the three panels (separated by distance to the cluster centre as shown in the legend) are $\log M_{\rm sat}/M_\odot=11.8,11.8,12.2$. The dashed lines show the signal predicted by the average stellar masses of galaxies in each bin (the cluster contribution is not included). Note how the signal from the cluster moves to larger scales for galaxies further away from the centre.}
